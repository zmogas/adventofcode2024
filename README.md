Solving https://adventofcode.com/2024 with JS

I am late this year, so this projext is for my self only :D

node in console should be fast. Much faster than preparing HTML and rendering it in browser.

## How to run

1. Fill in data in file `01.txt`
1. Run `node 01.js` from console
1. The answer will be calculated and outputed

## Process

- Usually I copy over start of file to new day challenge file. Then adjust `day`.
- Demo data I put to `01d.txt` and adjust `day` to `1d`. Then demo data will be read and answer calculated.
- When demo answer is correct, I proceed with data assigned to me.
- And hope that it will run correctly from first time. :)
